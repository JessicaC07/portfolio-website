        <section id="about">
            <p>Hi there!</p>
            <p>I am Jessica. I have a <b>French and Chinese background</b> that led me to be very curious and passionate about travels and languages.
            I am bilingual French - English, fluent in Spanish and can understand Chinese Mandarin.</p>
            <p>I was always interested in our digital environment, so I completed a <b>Master's degree in marketing</b> and started combining both passions - I worked in Montreal, Barcelona, New York City & Vancouver in <b>digital marketing</b>, as well as <b>freelancing since 2018</b>.</p>
            <p>I quickly realized I love working on the technical aspect of my roles - technical SEO, email automation, but especially editing and optimizing websites. This led me to enroll in the <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/programs/front-end-web-developer-certificate-full-time-distance-and-online-learning-6535cert/#overview" target="_blank"><b>Front-End Web Development Certificate</a> at BCIT, Vancouver</b> which I completed in June 2022.</p>
            <p>I deepened my <b>HTML/ CSS</b> knowledge and learning so much, especially more advanced web technologies such as <b>React and the Javascript ecosystem</b>. The program also taught us design/ UX, as well as backend development with <b>PHP/ WordPress</b>, and ecommerce platforms such as <b>Shopify and WooCommerce</b>.</p>
            <p>Oh, I have two other hobbies - food & red wine!</p>
